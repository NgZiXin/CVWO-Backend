# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

# MainThread.create([ 
#   { 
#     title: "First test",
#     body: "testing",
#     category_id: 1,
#     country: "US",
#     user_id: 1

#   }
# ]);

# Comment.create([
#     { 
#     body: "Nice :D",
#     main_thread_id: 1,
#     user_id: 1
#   }
# ]);

# Category.create([
#     { 
#         category: "GENERAL",
#     },
#     { 
#         category: "ADVICE",
